   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

   npm --version
   ```

##### Alternative installation via Homebrew

```

### Login to npm

If you are planning to publishing modules to the npm registry you should login with your npm account.

1. Visit [https://www.npmjs.com/signup](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) and create a npm account. Skip this step if you already have a npm account;
2. Login to npm from your machine;

   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

3. Verify you are logged in to npm.

   ```bash
   npm whoami
   ```

   You should be able to see your username displayed in the terminal.

### Working with private modules

1. Append the following to your .bash_profile;

```bash
export NPM_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.npmrc | awk -F'authToken=' '{print $2}')
```

2. Create a new `/.npmrc` file in the root folder of your project, with the following contents;

```bash
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```
